                <p class="writing">Fonts play a crucial role in web design, as they contribute to the overall look and feel of a website or application, enhancing readability and conveying a particular visual identity or branding. Different fonts can evoke different moods or convey specific messages, allowing designers to express their creativity and tailor the typography to match the content and purpose of the website or application. </p>
            <h3  class="info-header">Our Definition</h3>
                <p class="writing">Fonts that provoke a psychological reaction can be used to make a brand feel more trustworthy, friendly, or aspirational, with designers often turning to emotional fonts to give brand identities a powerful psychological impact. </p>
                 <p class="writing">Fonts can create mood and atmosphere. Fonts can give visual clues about the order a document should be read in and which parts are more important than others. Fonts can even be used to control how long it takes someone to read a document. The professional printing industry has recognized this fact for a long time.</p>

                            <p class="writing">Dosis is another font that has a very unique and “modern”, clean look. Its letters have a more-rounded shape, but it will add a lot of character and legibility to your website. It has light weights that can be used in large titles. Both fonts can help to add more character to your designs Dosis is great for brands that want to communicate warmth and grace. A font with rounded stroke caps also works well with other circular shapes. If your brand has these two things, give Dosis a try!</p>

                            <p class="font-writing">We have noticed that Open Sans has become one of the most used fonts on the web. A lot of big-name brands are going through the process of cleaning up their websites and a lot of them go with Open Sans or Lato to offer high readability and a friendly appearance. Open Sans has excellent legibility, and its letterforms are incredibly strong with the very extensive font library, this font is a very strong substitute for default sans serif fonts. 3</p>
